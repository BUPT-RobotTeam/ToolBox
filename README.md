This is a GUI written using the Qt toolkit to make the test more easier.



## Prerequisitesï¼š

1. [Eigen3](eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download): download Eigen 3.4.0 from this URL: https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip. 

2. [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) : We use **mosek** for solving second-order cone program(SOCP). To use mosek, you should approve an academic license in [here](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/). The academic license is free and is easy to approve. The license file should be placed inside a folder called "mosek"  under the user's home directory (``$HOME/mosek/mosek.lic`` or  ``%USERPROFILE%\mosek\mosek.lic``). In most typical cases that will be:

   1. ``/home/YOUR_USER_NAME/mosek/mosek.lic``      (Linux)        

   2. ``/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/mosek/mosek.lic``     (OSX)        

   3. ``C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\mosek\mosek.lic``   (Windows)

   All header and library files are already included in the ``time_optimizer/mosek8_1``  folder under this repo, so you don't need to download mosek again.
